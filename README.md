# Abuja Hospital Wait Times

A community-driven web application that helps users find hospitals in Abuja with the shortest emergency room wait times.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Map**: View hospital locations with color-coded wait time indicators
- **Real-time Data**: Community-reported wait times updated in real-time
- **Search & Filter**: Find hospitals by name or location
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Submit wait times and capacity reports without registration
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices

## üè• How It Works

1. **View**: See hospitals on an interactive map with current wait time estimates
2. **Report**: Submit anonymous reports about wait times and bed availability
3. **Decide**: Choose the best hospital based on community data

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

- Node.js 18 or later
- A Supabase account
- A Mapbox account (optional, uses included token by default)

### Quick Start

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token (optional)

   ```

5. **Set up the database**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Open the SQL Editor
   - Run the SQL script from `supabase/migrations/create_hospital_schema.sql`

6. **Import hospital data**
   ```bash
   npm run import-osm
   ```

7. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üìä Database Schema

The app uses three main tables:

- **hospitals**: Store hospital information (name, location, contact details)
- **reports**: Store user-submitted wait time reports
- **aggregated_wait**: Materialized view with calculated average wait times

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | Yes |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Your Supabase anonymous key | Yes |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Your Supabase service role key | Yes |
| `MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Mapbox access token for maps | No* |

*A default Mapbox token is included for development

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the migration script to set up tables and policies
3. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) - this is handled by the migration
4. Set up the refresh function for real-time aggregation

## üöÄ Deployment

### Static Hosting (Recommended)

The app is a static web application that can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. **Build the app**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `public/` folder** to your hosting service:
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - GitHub Pages
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   - Any static hosting service

### Environment Variables for Production

Make sure to set your production environment variables in your hosting service's dashboard.

### Database Maintenance

Set up a cron job or scheduled function to refresh the aggregated wait times:

1. Deploy the refresh function to Supabase Edge Functions
2. Schedule it to run every 15 minutes
3. Or use any external cron service to call the function URL

## üì± Progressive Web App (PWA)

The app includes PWA capabilities:

- Installable on mobile devices
- Offline-ready manifest
- App-like experience

To customize the PWA:
1. Update `public/manifest.json`
2. Add your own app icons (`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`)

- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based rate limiting for report submissions
- **Data Sanitization**: Comments are automatically sanitized
- **Row Level Security**: Database access controlled by RLS policies

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

The app includes views for analytics:
- Daily report counts per hospital
- Average wait times over time
- Hospital popularity metrics
